A Java command line application to solve sudoku puzzles using recursive backtracking. Developed for university coursework in my second year.

The assignment brief and marker's feedback are also uploaded in the repository; I scored 98%.

The sudoku puzzle which the lecturer supplied for testing our solutions with is also uploaded (was supplied as a .txt file).
